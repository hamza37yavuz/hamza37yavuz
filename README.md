Hello! I'm Muhammet Hamza Yavuz, a sophomore student studying Computer Engineering at Istanbul Medeniyet University.
I am passionate about the field of cybersecurity and actively enhance my skills by solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Additionally, I strive to share my experiences and knowledge about CTFs by writing walktrough on the subject.
Moreover, I have a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I constantly work on improving myself in these areas by attending related courses and workshops. With my accumulated knowledge in data analysis, deep learning, and algorithms, I am actively seeking opportunities to develop projects in these domains.
